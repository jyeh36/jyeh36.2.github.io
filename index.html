        <h3>About Us: </h3>
        
        <p> Our venture into the FIRST Robotics competition actually began in 2007, where our mentor, Mr. John Edgar, founded Team 2007, who were known as the Robots of the Round Table. They competed for 3 years, but unfortunately were not able to sustain themselves due to lack of members. The team disbanded soon after.
</p>

        <p>In 2014, a small group of students got together once again to revive the FRC program at Duluth High School, where they established Team 5293, small team of ~10 students and ~3 mentors. Since then, weâ€™ve slowly grown to a community of over 30 students, with plenty more soon to come.
